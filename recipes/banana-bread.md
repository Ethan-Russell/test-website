This is a simple banana bread recipe. I like it because it only requires 2 large ripe bananas. It can be used for a dozen muffins, a loaf pan, or an 8x8 pan.

- 1/2 c sugar
- 1/2 c oil
- 2 Tbs ground flax seeds soaked for 10 minutes in 5 Tbs water, or you can use 2 eggs
- 2 big, ripe bananas or 3 smaller ones
- 1 tsp vanilla if you've got it
- 1 2/3 c flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp cinnamon
- pinch of nutmeg if you've got it
- (Optional) handful of walnuts OR hazelnuts (pro tip from Hannah)
- (Optional) 1/3 c chocolate chips

## Instructions
- Preheat oven to 350.
- Mash the bananas in mixing bowl.
- Whisk in the sugar and other wet ingredients.
- Measure out the rest of the dry ingredients on top of the wet.
- Stir up the dry ingredients on top of the the wet before folding into the wet ingredients.
- If using chocolate chips or nuts, mix in half
- Pour batter into greased pan or muffin tins.
- If using chocolate chips or nuts, top with the other half
- Bake at 350 until toothpick test comes out clean, roughly:
  - 8x8 pan: ~30 minutes
  - Muffins: 20-25 minutes
  - Loaf pan: 45-55 minutes
