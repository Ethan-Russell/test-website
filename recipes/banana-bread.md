This is a simple banana bread recipe. I like it because it only requires 2 large ripe bananas. It can be used for a dozen muffins or an 8x8 pan. Probably a loaf too, but I haven't tried that.

## Ingredients
- 2/3 c sugar
- 1/2 c oil
- 2 eggs
- 2 big bananas or 3 smaller ones
- 1 tsp vanilla if you've got it
- 1 2/3 c flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp cinnamon
- pinch of nutmeg if you've got it
- (Optional) handful of walnuts OR hazelnuts (pro tip from Hannah)

## Instructions
- Preheat oven to 350.
- Mash the bananas in mixing bowl.
- Whisk in the sugar and other wet ingredients.
- Measure out the rest of the dry ingredients on top of the wet.
- Stir up the dry ingredients on top of the the wet before folding into the wet ingredients.
- Dump batter into greased 8x8 or muffin tins.
- Sprinkle walnuts on top if desired.
- Bake until toothpick test comes out clean, roughly:
  - 8x8 pan: ~30 minutes
  - Muffins: 20-25 minutes
