Aren't sesame seeds white? And how could they belong in a cake??

I learned about black sesame seeds in the kitchen of Hannah's grandmother, Chu Yee. Grandma Chu is an inspiring woman with a big heart and many amazing stories. She learned to cook mostly on her own, starting as a child cooking for her busy family on a big wok over a wood fired stove in rural China.  I learned about black sesame seeds from her.

Black sesame seeds can provide a beautiful color and texture contrast, and they offer a complex, nutty flavor. They can navigate sweet or savory terrain. Equally at home as a finish for fried rice, or ground into a sweet paste and stuffed in chewy rice balls and boiled in a sweet ginger soup.

So where did black sesame cake come from?  After much deliberation, Hannah requested a black sesame strawberry shortcake for her birthday in February. Below is my attempt, which turned out well! After we tried it, we determined that the black sesame flavor is best left pure, without the strawberries. In the future, we thought it would be more satisfying with a brownie/blondie consistency.

## Ingredients
- 3 TBS sugar
- 3 TBS toasted black sesame seeds (toast in a dry pan if needed)
- 1 TBS butter (substitute oil if needed)
- 1 egg
- ½ tsp vanilla extract
- ¾ cup all purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking powder
- ⅛ tsp salt
- ¼ cup milk (any kind)

## Directions
- preheat oven to 350
- butter a 4x8 inch loaf pan
- grind sugar and sesame seeds together in baby food processor (mortar and pestle might work too?) until they form a paste
- incorporate butter into paste
- whisk in bowl with egg and vanilla
- whisk dry ingredients together separately
- add dry ingredients to sesame mixture, alternating with the milk
- add to pan and bake for 15-20 minutes until toothpick comes out dry

## Improvements

Next time try cutting out the egg, or maybe adding black beans for more color and denser texture
