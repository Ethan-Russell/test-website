Beet soup with cumin and turmeric to compliment the earthiness and sweetness of the beets.

## Ingredients
- 1 Tbs oil (canola/vegetable oil is good, nothing fancy needed)
- 1 onion, medium, diced
- 3-4 cloves garlic
- 3/4 pound of beets, scrubbed and chopped, not peeled (skins are nutritious an good to eat)
- 2 potatoes, diced
- 1 tsp cumin
- 1/2 tsp dill (not sure how important this one was, omit if you don't have it)
- 1/2 tsp pepper (or more to taste)
- 1/2 tsp turmeric
- 1 tsp salt
- Boiling water to cover (or chicken/veggie stock if you have it, but I used water)
- Cilantro
- Yogurt

## Instructions
- Start the kettle for the boiling water/stock
- Brown the onions, garlic and potato in oil in a soup pot, or instant pot if you have it (saute function). You kinda want brown stuff on the bottom of the pan - that's good flavor! It could take some time (10-15 minutes) to get things nice and brown, but it's worth it!
- Add the spices, stir a bit
- Add some of the boiling water, scrape up all the brown bits from the bottom of the pot
- Add the beets and enough boiling water to just cover everything
- Cook for a while, until everything is soft. In the instant pot I did 14 minutes at high pressure, but 30 minutes on the stove should be good?
- Puree, taste, add more salt and pepper as needed, and serve with a dollop of yogurt. Enjoy!!
