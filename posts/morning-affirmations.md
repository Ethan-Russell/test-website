_This is a set of daily affirmations adapted by Joe Marcucci._

## 1. Submitting to God
Because of all You have done for me, I present my body to You as a living sacrifice for this day. I want to be transformed by the renewing of my mind, affirming that Your will for me is good and acceptable and perfect. (Romans 12:1–2)
## 2. Adoration and Thanksgiving
* Offer brief words of praise to the Father, Son and Holy Spirit for one or more of our Triune God’s perfections.
* The communicable perfections, i.e. those perfections that the Triune God shares with us: love, compassion, grace, mercy, holiness, goodness, truthfulness and justice.
* The Incommunicable perfections, i.e. those perfections that the Triune God does not share with us: omnipotence, omnipresence, omniscience, unchanging character, independence and eternality.
* God’s works: creation, promises, restraining evil, redemption, adoption, reconciliation, justification, sanctification, abiding presence, empowering presence, second coming, new heavens and new earth and final judgment.
* Thank the Father, Son and Holy Spirit for the good things in your life.
## 3. Examination
* Ask the Spirit to search your heart and reveal any areas of unconfessed sin. \
_Take a Moment of Silence, then the leader reads and people **respond.**_
* Grant your faithful people, merciful Lord, pardon and peace; that we may be cleansed from all our sins, and serve you with a quiet mind; through Jesus Christ our Lord.\
**Amen**
* Thank you Lord for forgiving our sins and cleansing us from all unrighteousness.  In you there is no condemnation. Because of your great mercy you have caused us to be born again to a living hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.  The old has passed and we are new creations being remade in your likeness, prepared for good works.\
**Amen**
* Dear Lord, thank you that you are with us as we pray.  Help us with our weaknesses and increase our faith.  Fill us with the Holy Spirit and empower us as we seek you and your purposes in prayer.\
**Amen**
* Now to him who is able to do far more abundantly than all we ask or think according to the power at work within us, to him be glory in the church and in our prayers.\
**Amen**

## 4. My Identity in Christ
* “I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me, and gave Himself up for me.” (Galatians 2:20)
* I have forgiveness from the penalty of sin because Christ died for me. (Romans 5:8; 1 Corinthians 15:3)
* I have freedom from the power of sin because I died with Christ. (Colossians 2:11; 1 Peter 2:24)
* I have fulfillment for this day because Christ lives in me. (Philippians 1:20–21)

## 5. Filling of the Spirit
* Father in heaven, fill me with the Holy Spirit today.  May I be guided by the inspiration and convictions of the Spirit.
* I want to be filled with the Spirit (Ephesians 5:18). When I walk by the Spirit, I will not carry out the desire of the flesh (Galatians 5:16). If I live by the Spirit, I will also walk by the Spirit (Galatians 5:25).

## 6. Fruit of the Spirit
* May the fruit of the Spirit be evident in my life today: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. (Galatians 5:22–23)
* May I walk in love today towards all people, those I see, and those I do not see.  
* May my thoughts, words and deeds towards others be grounded in love.
* “Love is patient, love is kind, and is not jealous; love does not brag and is not arrogant, does not act unbecomingly; it does not seek its own, is not provoked, does not take into account a wrong suffered, does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth; bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.” (1 Corinthians 13:4–7)

## 7. Purpose of My Life
* I want to love the Lord my God with all my heart, and with all my soul, and with all my mind, and I want to love my neighbor as myself (Matthew 22:37, 39). My purpose is to love God completely, love self correctly, and love others compassionately.
* I will seek first Your kingdom and Your righteousness. (Matthew 6:33)
* I have been called to follow Christ and to be a fisher of men. (Matthew 4:19)
* I will be a witness to those who do not know Him and participate in the Great Commission to go and make disciples. (Matthew 28:19–20; Acts 1:8)
* I want to glorify the Father by bearing much fruit, and so prove to be Christ’s disciple. (John 15:8)

## 8. Circumstances of the Day

* “God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.” (Romans 8:28; also see 8:29)
* I acknowledge that You are in control of all things in my life, and that You have my best interests at heart. Because of this I will trust and obey You today.
* Review and commit the events of this day into the hands of God.

## 9. Protection in the Warfare

### Against the World: RENEW
* I will set my mind on the things of the Spirit. (Romans 8:5)
* Since I have been raised up with Christ, I will keep seeking the things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. I will set my mind on the things above, not on the things that are on earth. (Colossians 3:1–2; also see 3:3–4 and Hebrews 12:1–2)
* I will be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving I will let my requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all comprehension, shall guard my heart and my mind in Christ Jesus. Whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is of good repute, if there is any excellence and if anything worthy of praise, I will let my mind dwell on these things. (Philippians 4:6–9)

### Against the Flesh: RECKON
* I know that my old self was crucified with Christ, so that I am no longer a slave to sin, for he who has died is freed from sin. I will reckon myself as dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus. I will not present the members of my body to sin as instruments of unrighteousness, but I will present myself to God as one alive from the dead, and my members as instruments of righteousness to God. (Romans 6:6–7, 11, 13)

### Against the Devil: RESIST
* As I submit myself to God and resist the devil, he will flee from me. (James 4:7)
* I will be of sober spirit and on the alert. My adversary, the devil, prowls about like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour. But I will resist him, firm in my faith. (1 Peter 5:8–9)
* I will take up the full armor of God, that I may be able to resist and stand firm. I put on the belt of truth and the breastplate of righteousness; I put on my feet the preparation of the gospel of peace; and I take up the shield of faith with which I will be able to extinguish all the flaming missiles of the evil one. I take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. With all prayer and petition I will pray at all times in the Spirit and be on the alert with all perseverance and petition for all the saints. (Ephesians 6:13–18)

## 10. The Coming of Christ and My Future with Him
* Your kingdom come, Your will be done. (Matthew 6:10)
* You have said, “I am coming quickly.” Amen. Come, Lord Jesus. (Revelation 22:20)
* I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that is to be revealed to me. (Romans 8:18)
* I will not lose heart, but though my outer man is decaying, yet my inner man is being renewed day by day. For momentary, light affliction is producing for me an eternal weight of glory far beyond all comparison, while I look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen; for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal. (2 Corinthians 4:16–18)
* My citizenship is in heaven, from which also I eagerly wait for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ. (Philippians 3:20)

Beloved, now we are God’s children, and it has not appeared as yet what we will be. We know that when He appears, we will be like Him, because we will see Him just as He is. And everyone who has this hope fixed on Him purifies himself, just as He is pure. (1 John 3:2–3)

## The Lord's Prayer
Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy Name,\
thy kingdom come, thy will be done, \
on earth as it is in heaven. \
Give us this day our daily bread.\
And forgive us our trespasses,\
as we forgive those who trespass against us. \
And lead us not into temptation, \
but deliver us from evil. \
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, \
for ever and ever. Amen.

## Responsive Prayers
O Lord, show your mercy upon us;\
&nbsp;&nbsp;*And grant us your salvation.* \
O Lord, guide those who govern us;\
&nbsp;&nbsp;*And lead us in the way of justice and truth.*\
Clothe your ministers with righteousness;\
&nbsp;&nbsp;*and let your people sing with joy.*\
O Lord, save your people.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;*and bless your inheritance.*\
Give peace, O Lord, in all the world; \
&nbsp;&nbsp;*and defend us by your mighty power.*\
Lord, keep this nation under your care; \
&nbsp;&nbsp;*And guide us in the way of justice and truth.*\
Let your way be known upon earth; \
&nbsp;&nbsp;*Your salvation to the ends of the earth.*\
Let not the needy, O Lord, be forgotten; \
&nbsp;&nbsp;*Nor the hope of the poor be taken away.*\
Create in us clean hearts, O God; \
&nbsp;&nbsp;*And sustain us with your Holy Spirit.*
