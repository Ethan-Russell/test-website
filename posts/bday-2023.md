I've never been too keen on birthday celebrations, or really anything that puts me at the center of attention.  As Hannah pointed out yesterday, I tend to get very red when that happens...  Anyway, I wanted to share a little about what I did to celebrate, embracing the love that I was shown rather than turning away from it.

The day started off by opening a box from my friend Andy MacGregor.  Inside the box was a hand-carved chip clip.  I absolutely love how Andy combines unexpected, mundane, and thoughtful into one little creation.

Hannah told me she had mystery plans for the afternoon - she surprised me by gathering several friends from church into the house of Kevin Gaudry, where we got to tour his garden, make some music together, and enjoy some french delicacies.  I can't think of any better way to spend the afternoon!

Thank you to everyone who made the day special - I feel abundantly loved.
